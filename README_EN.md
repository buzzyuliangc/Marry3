<span style="font-weight:300">Marry in Web3 with another 0x address, get the Soulbound NFT Certificate on the chain, a non-financial Dapp</span>

### What is Marry3?

Marry3 is an on-chain Dapp developed based on the ERC520 standard contract. Its core is mainly:

- ERC520 Token, which is an extension of the standard ERC721 token, it has some special features, it is non-transferable, non-sellable, and an address can only have one token at the same time.
- The Marry3 contract and Dapp implement the logic of payment and multi-signature verification (analogous to negotiated marriage proposal, negotiated divorce, etc. in the real world).

In the future, he will also add other capabilities, such as basic multi-signature contracts (compatible with multi-signature wallets) and mutual savings contracts. Interested students are welcome to discuss together.

### What does Marry3 want to express?

Marry3 is a social experiment project. His original idea originated from the bottom-level thinking of the 0x address in Web3 as an aboriginal, and his landing idea was based on thinking about some unhealthy status quo of the Web3 ecology.

#### 0x Aboriginal

The 0x address is the aboriginal in Web3, and all behaviors and data on the chain depend on it.

Web3 is a new world composed of 0x natives. It has a new order and rules (Code is Law), a new organization (DAO), a new identity (NFT&ENS), and a new aboriginal (0x address)

Based on this premise, I have been making an analogy between this new world and human society, excluding different residents and different laws, they also have some things in common, such as the relationship between addresses and addresses, addresses have their own social status, social credit, etc. .

Does the address and address need to have a relatively more intimate relationship?

Address aside, why do we humans establish intimacy? I believe that it is not only because of love, but also not only reproduction, but more importantly, in this society, such a most basic social relationship is needed to cooperate with social activities, such as joint maintenance of property, cooperation and division of labor, mutual risk sharing, mutual guarantee, etc.

Going back to the 0x address natives and the new world of Web3, I will ask myself, why can't we build the same relationship for them, and whether it is necessary to explore and experiment with such a relationship?

Thanks to the many foundational elements of Web3 that provide us with the basis for an interesting application.

- Thanks to Web3 for bringing the possibility of breaking the physical limitations of the information society, now any address and address can be intimately related, without restrictions on gender, age, race, or even species!
- At the same time, the blockchain provides a rule guarantee (Code is Law) for this relationship, which cannot be tampered with, cannot be transferred, and is open and transparent.

#### Unhealthy Web3 Status

After entering the Web3 world, I often reflect on the Web3 world I see in my eyes. I firmly believe in the underlying ideas of Web3, and I am willing to believe in his ideals and beliefs, but in reality, what I see more is the ubiquitous bubbles and monotony. ecology.

Of course, I firmly believe that these are phased products. The ecological problem shows that this industry still has great opportunities for development. In the future, there will be more revolutions in this industry, which will push it to an interesting, useful, beneficial, rich and healthy state. .

And as buidlers, what can we do?

- Adhere to long-term value
- Make interesting or useful applications
- Use Web3 features to solve social problems

Instead of simply making money, helping others make money, and giving users the illusion of making money.

So we decided to implement the Marry3 project like this:

- Do not issue NFTs and tokens for speculation, NFTs are only used as Soulbound NFTs.
- Users pay for services because they are fun or useful to consume our products, not because they make money.

### Social Significance

The above two points are our reflections on the current situation, and ultimately become our source of inspiration and implementation method. This project is a social experimental work. We hope that all users who use the product can experience the concept of 0x aboriginal people from the product. And think about the status quo of Web3.

In this way, the significance of our development of this project has been achieved, and no matter how it develops in the future, this is its most important social significance.
