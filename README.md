ERC721-520 Token is an implementation of NFT-like Soulbound Token Standard, which is an extension of ERC721 standard.

- ERC721-520 Tokens are non-transferable and non-sellable, one person can only have one valid Token at the same time
- After the ERC721-520 Token is negotiated by the two parties through multi-signature, Mint will issue 2 Tokens at one time
- ERC721-520 Tokens can be destroyed through multi-signature negotiation, and new Tokens can be minted with other addresses after destruction

Marry3 is an on-chain Dapp developed based on the ERC721-520 standard contract. Its core implements:

- Marry3 Certificate, based on the ERC721-520 standard, it has some special features, it is non-transferable, non-sellable, and an address can only have one Token at the same time.
- The Marry3 contract and Dapp implement the logic of payment and multi-signature verification (analogous to negotiated marriage proposal, negotiated divorce, etc. in the real world).

In the future, he will add other abilities, including MarryDAO/LovesDAO/Marry3verse, etc. For details, see: Roadmap

#### express

Marry3 is a social experiment project. His original idea originated from the bottom-level thinking about the 0x address in Web3 as an aboriginal, and his landing idea was based on thinking about some unhealthy status quo of the Web3 ecology. The answer is a non-tradable, non-transferable, pair-bound no-finance nft, which fits perfectly with the idea of ​​SBTs (soulbound tokens).

#### soulbound token

A while ago, after studying V God's speech & paper, we are more certain about the development ideas of soulbound no-finance nft-like token. We believe that the next Web3 application boom will rise because of this point of view.

1. First of all, in the Web3 world, 0x addresses are natives, not "users" or you and me.
2. When an address is bound to more and more no-finance identity nfts, the no-finance nft and the identity data and social relationship data behind it will become a very vivid expression of the aborigines of the 0x address, making it Personality, credibility, preferences
3. The cost of forging such an identity will also be higher, especially if there is no profit-driven (no-finance) premise.

A future soulbound no-finance nft-like token could be the key to giving 0x natives a credible personality

#### 0x address

The 0x address is the aboriginal in Web3, and all behaviors and data on the chain depend on it.

Web3 is a new world composed of 0x aborigines, it has a new order and rules (Code is Law), a new way of social organization (DAO), a new personal identity (NFT&ENS), and a new aboriginal (0x address) )

Based on this premise, I have been making an analogy between this new world and human society, excluding different residents and different laws, they also have some things in common, such as the relationship between addresses and addresses, addresses have their own social status, social credit, etc. .

Does the address and address need to have a relatively more intimate relationship? There should also be a more important social identity and relationship between an organization-oriented DAO and an individual-oriented identity.

Address aside, why do we humans establish intimacy? I believe that it is not only because of love, but also not only reproduction, but more importantly, in this society, such a most basic social relationship is needed to cooperate with social activities, such as joint maintenance of property, cooperation and division of labor, mutual risk sharing, mutual guarantee, etc.

Going back to the 0x address natives and the new world of Web3, I will ask myself, why can't we build the same relationship for them, is there a need to explore and experiment with such a relationship?

Thanks to the many foundational elements of Web3 for providing us with the basis for an interesting application of social experimentation.

- Web3 brings the possibility of breaking through the physical limitations of the information society, and now any address and address can form an intimate relationship, regardless of geography, gender, age, race, and even species!
- At the same time, the blockchain provides a rule guarantee (Code is Law) for this relationship, the relationship is on the chain, cannot be tampered with, and cannot be transferred,Open and transparent.

#### less healthy ecology

After entering the Web3 world, I often reflect on the Web3 world I see in my eyes. I firmly believe in the underlying ideas of Web3, and I am willing to believe in his ideals and beliefs, but in reality, what I see more is the ubiquitous bubbles and monotony. ecology.

Of course, I firmly believe that these are phased products. The ecological problem shows that this industry still has great opportunities for development. In the future, there will be more revolutions in this industry, which will push it to an interesting, useful, beneficial, rich and healthy state. .

And as buidlers, what can we do?

- Adhere to long-term value
- Make interesting or useful applications
- Use Web3 features to solve social problems

Instead of simply making money, helping others make money, and giving users the illusion of making money.

So we decided to implement the Marry3 project like this:

- Do not issue NFTs for speculation and trading, NFTs are only used as Soulbound NFTs.
- Users pay for services because they are fun or useful to consume our products, not because they make money.

#### Social Significance
      
The above two points are our reflections on the current situation, and ultimately become our source of inspiration and implementation method. This project is a social experimental work. We hope that all users who use the product can experience the concept of 0x aboriginal people from the product. , the importance of intimacy, and thinking about the current state of Web3, we are looking forward to seeing rich applications built on this intimate social relationship, and all of our relationship data is open.

In this way, the significance of our development of this project has been achieved, and no matter how it develops in the future, this is its most important social significance.
